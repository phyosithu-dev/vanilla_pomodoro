## About The Project

This project was developed to practice and showcase core front-end web development skills without relying on external frameworks or libraries. It demonstrates a solid understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management in JavaScript to create a functional and interactive user experience.

## Features

* **Three Timer Modes**: Easily switch between "Pomodoro" (25 min), "Short Break" (5 min), and "Long Break" (15 min) sessions.
* **Dynamic UI**: The background color and button styles change dynamically to match the current timer mode, providing clear visual cues.
* **Task Management**:
    * Add tasks with a title, estimated Pomodoro sessions, and optional notes.
    * View your created tasks in a clean list format.
* **Audio Cues**: Includes click sounds for interaction and a "cheer" sound to signal the completion of a timer session.
* **Session Tracking**: The app keeps track of your focus sessions and lets you know when it's time for a break or time to get back to work.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be functional and look good on various screen sizes.
